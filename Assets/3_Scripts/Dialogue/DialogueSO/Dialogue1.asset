  - characterName: SP3-KER
    conversation: $wait/1 SP3-4KR is an early version of a project called B4B6-20,
      created to merge DJ Bren's electro and DJ Bran's house music into a powerful
      psytrance track.
  - characterName: SP3-KER
    conversation: The purpose of SP3-4KR was to harmoniously fuse these genres and
      grant its owners control over the city. [Closing database . .
  - characterName: Tekno
    conversation: $emotion/confused So you were the first AI created by DJ Bren and
      DJ Bran, who led to the creation of psytrance. I think you can help me free
      this city from their grasp.
  - characterName: SP3-KER
    conversation: '$emotion/confused According to the database, my music core is
      incomplete, as my core was unable to fully merge the 2 genres which led to
      a missing genre in my core. '
  - characterName: SP3-KER
    conversation: $emotion/normal For my core to fully function, I require three
      different genres. Currently, I only have Electro and House in my system.
  - characterName: Tekno

  - characterName: Tekno
    conversation: $emotion/normal SP3-4KR, although it might not be much, I wonder
      if this track is compatible enough for your core.

  - characterName: SP3-KER
    conversation: $emotion/happy It's done! Although it might need refinement, I
      believe we can optimize the compatibility of this genre over time.
  - characterName: Tekno
    conversation: $emotion/happy Great! Let's head to the simulation room to test
      it out. Follow me to the elevator on the right.
