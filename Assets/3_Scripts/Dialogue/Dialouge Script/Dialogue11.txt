Title: Stage3 final

--

SP3-KER: $emotion/normal Alright in this last part it is a combination of everything you have learned so far. 

SP3-KER:There is one more thing I need to teach you Tekno. 

SP3-KER: Depending on the song you are listening to the speed of the environment changes according to the current BPM of the track that is currently playing. To sum it up for you.Electro mode Makes things go faster at 160 BPM and House Mode makes things move slower at 140 BPM.

Tekno: What about Techno?

SP3-KER: As I haven't fully analysed Techno yet. Techno resets the world to its original speed at 140 BPM.

SP3-KER_Happy: Now Let's go!
