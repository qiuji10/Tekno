Tekno: $emotion/angry Whoever designed how the hook works is a bad designer!


SP3-KER: $emotion/happy Would you like me to access the database for that information?


Tekno: #emotion/normal No it's Fine, let us continue.

Tekno: $emotion/confused Wait! What is that?  It looks like a giant Amplifier 

SP3-KER: Would you like me to access the database for that information?

Tekno: $emotion/normal Yes

SP3-KER: $emotion/database Accessing Datatbase

SP3-KER: The A-M-P module or Amp for short is an Amplifier speaker device constructed to Blast psytrance music in an area keeping its listeners under its influence.

Tekno: So these are the things that have been popping up in Ibiza these past few months.

SP3-KER: $emotion/normal There is a way that we can take control of them.

Tekno: $emotion/confused How?

SP3-KER: $emotion/normal According to my calculations, Techno isn't fully integrated into my core yet, thus it is malleable enough to be used to hack the amplifiers and seize control of them.

SP3-KER: Let's try it out! Tekno

Tekno: Alright
