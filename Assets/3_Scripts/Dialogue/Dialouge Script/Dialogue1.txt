Tekno:$emotion/normal  Alright, That should do it.

SP3-KER: $wait/1 Hello, I am SP3-4KR, your personal- [ Sudden distortion and static interrupting the sentence ] $play/updown/8  $emotion/confused  Where am I? Who are you? What is happening? [ Looks around in confusion, disoriented ]

Tekno: Calm down, I'm not sure myself but I was hoping that you hold the key to end this chaos. $wait/1

Tekno:  What exactly are you?

SP3-KER: $emotion/database  Accessing database . . . $wait/1 

SP3-KER:$play/updown/8 [ SP3-4KR retrieves information from its past, stored in the database ]   $wait/1

SP3-KER: SP3-4KR is an early version of a project called B4B6-20, created to merge DJ Bren's electro and DJ Bran's house music into a powerful psytrance track. 

SP3-KER:The purpose of SP3-4KR was to harmoniously fuse these genres and grant its owners control over the city. $wait/1 Closing database . . 

Tekno: $emotion/confused So you were the first AI created by DJ Bren and DJ Bran, who led to the creation of psytrance. I think you can help me free this city from their grasp.

SP3-KER: $emotion/confused According to the database, my music core is incomplete, as my core was unable to fully merge the 2 genres which led to a missing genre in my core. $wait/1 

SP3-KER: $emotion/normal For my core to fully function, I require three different genres. Currently, I only have Electro and House in my system.


Tekno: Is there a way to search for the missing genre?

SP3-KER: Initializing search in the DJ Database . . . 

SP3-KER:$wait/1 Scanning for compatible genres and associated DJs . . . $wait/1 

SP3-KER: $emotion/confused Search unsuccessful. All genres have been lost and converted. All associated DJs are either deceased or converted.

Tekno: $emotion/sad As I suspected, I'm really the last DJ left in Ibiza.  $wait/1 $emotion/normal SP3-4KR, although it might not be much, I wonder if this track is compatible enough for your core.


SP3-KER: $emotion/database Analyzing the track . . . $wait/1

SP3-KER: Genre_Techno . . . $wait/1

SP3-KER: Compatibility: 40%.  $wait/1 

SP3-KER: Integrating the genre . . .$wait/1

SP3-KER: Integration complete. 


SP3-KER:$emotion/happy It's done! Although it might need refinement, I believe we can optimize the compatibility of this genre over time.

Tekno: $emotion/happy Great! Let's head to the simulation room to test it out. Follow me to the elevator on the right.
